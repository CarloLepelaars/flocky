`flocky` makes participating in [Flock.io](https://www.flock.io) easy!

**NOTE:** This project is not officially affiliated with Flock.io. This
package is maintained by a participant of the Flock.io community. While
I strive for correctness, I cannot guarantee that this package is
bug-free. Always verify your own implementation, especially when using
`flocky` in production.

## Quickstart

``` python
from flocky.api import get_task

task = get_task(7)
print("Task title:", task['title'])
print("Task status:", task['status'])
```
